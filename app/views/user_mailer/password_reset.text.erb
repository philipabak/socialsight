Hi <%= @user.short_name %>, 

It seems you have forgotten your password, you scatterbrain!

Since we donâ€™t know what was the old one, you can reset it here:
<%= @link %>

Did you not request a password reminder? Then someone may be trying to get into your account.
Better change it again, just to be safe! You can change your password in your profile.
See you soon,
